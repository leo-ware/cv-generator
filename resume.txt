Experience

West Virginia University	Morgantown, WV
Research Assistant	Dec 2023 - Present
Developed a custom model validation pipeline, proving that a published result overestimated model performance by 2x
Developed a multi-threaded implementation of proposed ML technique, showing 5x speedup in training time relative to a prototype
Improved on the design of the technique, leading to 30% improved fit
Improved training times on another key model by 30x

Carnegie Mellon University	Pittsburgh, PA
Research Intern – Human Computer Interaction Institute	May 2022 - August 2022
Developed a machine learning based tool for human in the loop extraction of web content
Built an intuitive web-based interface, making the tool available to non-technical users
Collaborated with the data science team on the design of an LLM-based recommendation pipeline
Prepared a demo for a strategic partnership pitch to Firefox, the only intern selected to do so

SoftBank	San Francisco, CA
Software Engineer – Masason AI Incubator	June 2021 - September 2021
Developed a pitch and received $20,000 in seed-stage grant funding from the SoftBank Masason AI fund
Headed a three-person front-end development team, developing a project prototype in three months
Faced with performance issues, developed a custom data structure that cut render times by 90%
Iterated on product-market fit by conducting 5+ user-interviews, leading to a major pivot
Presented to the CEO of Deepcore and VP of SoftBank, resulting in continued funding for the project
  

Education

Minerva University	San Francisco, CA
BS - Major in Computational Sciences, Concentration in Data Science and Statistics	September 2019 - December 2023
Honed software engineering and computational modeling skills with classes in Data Structure & Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Causal Inference & Machine Learning
3.7 GPA
 

Projects

Undergraduate Capstone: Polynomial-Time General Causal Identification
Found and designed a fix for a bug in an open-source library by Microsoft Research with over 3k github stars, showing that ~50% of statistical significance tests were invalid
Invited to reimplement a key causal inference algorithm, developed a version that was more general, polynomial time and 60% faster
Published my work as an open-source library
Advised by Dr. Alexis Diamond
